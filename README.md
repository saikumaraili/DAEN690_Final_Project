## Overview

This is a collaborative research initiative between George Mason University students and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) addressing the critical challenge of wildlife strikes in aviation. This project leverages advanced data analytics and innovative mitigation strategies to enhance aviation safety and reduce economic losses.

## Problem Context and Importance
The problem of wildlife strikes, particularly bird collisions with aircraft, has become increasingly significant in the aviation industry. Here's the context and importance of this issue:

**Problem Context**     
- Approximately 272,000 wildlife strikes with civil aircraft were reported in the USA between 1990 and 2022.
- In 2022 alone, about 17,000 strikes were reported at 693 U.S. airports.
- U.S. Air Carriers reported 4,800 strikes at foreign airports between 1990 and 2022.

**Importance**     
- **Safety Concerns**: Wildlife strikes pose a significant threat to aviation safety, potentially causing damage to aircraft and endangering passengers and crew.
- **Increasing Frequency**: The number of strikes is rising, especially at altitudes above 152 meters, indicating that current wildlife management strategies at airports are insufficient.
- **Global Issue**: The problem extends beyond U.S. borders, affecting international flights and airports worldwide.
- **Environmental Considerations**: Addressing wildlife strikes is crucial not only for aviation safety and economic stability but also for conserving wildlife populations.
- **Technological Challenges**: The development of quieter aircraft has inadvertently increased the risk of collisions, as wildlife may not detect approaching planes as easily.
- **Data-Driven Solutions**: The FAA Wildlife Strike Database serves as a critical tool for understanding and mitigating this issue, emphasizing the need for comprehensive data collection and analysis.
- **Multifaceted Approach**: Addressing this problem requires a combination of habitat management, technological innovations, and community engagement, highlighting its complex nature.
